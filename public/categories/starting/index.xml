      <description>So, first off: The Golden Rule is bunk.
The central tenet, “treat others as you want to be treated” (sufficiently culturally embedded that my writing software auto-completes the phrase) appears in some form in every major world religion, as well as secular humanism and existentialism. It is a sentiment so universal as to be considered morally obvious.
This approach to ethics is based on empathy, on the ability to literally feel the emotions of another person.</description>
